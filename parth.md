# **Best App Design Practices in 2020**
An optimal and updated app design is important to increase interaction, engagement, and conversions. In other words, design that doesn't require users to think much and focuses on emotions, motivations, and needs.

App design does not only concern the user interface but it also includes usability, features, branding, design, and the experience it provides as a whole.

In this blog, you will get to know about the best app design practices in 2020 and learn how they can boost sales and retain users.

### **Why App Design Trends Are Important?**

Nowadays,  it is become much harder to create attention-grabbing products because everyone is overwhelmed with a constant flow of information. Moreover if  your product is valuable, but if it is difficult to use, nobody will waste time on finding out how to use it.

So to maximize the benefits of your product, it is best to include latest technology into your UI/UX design practices. Simple, human-centered design is the key to long-lasting client relationships. Not so long, having an attractive and unique product design was enough but things are different now. The human-centred approach has completely replaced system-centered one to become the main trend in 2020.

So what are the best practices in Mobile App Design for the year 2020? Let's start.

### **Tech Reasons for Modern App Design Trends**
Changing and advancing technologies have the biggest influence on the evolving UI/UX design.Let's review what's hot right now:

##### 1) Mass transition from 4G to 5G mobile data transfer:
 By the end of 2020, it is projected that 5G will be available to all. This will impact the design quite largely, as boring loading screens will become irrelevant. While high definition visualizations will become the essential.
 
#####  2) Instant Apps Vs Native Apps:
You don't need to download a fully functional app just to access a certain tool it offers. Therefore, UX/UI design should be adapted to instant apps and not overwhelm the user with features they don't need.

##### 3) Cloud solutions:
Cloud solutions integrated into mobile apps are projected to grow more in 2020. This means that the development cost will be reduced. This will shift the focus and resources largely on functionality and user interface.

##### 4) Passwordless unlock:
Entering data into fields during the login process is a thing of the past. All modern devices use FaceID or fingerprint authentication, so there is no need to remember your passwords and interrupt your interaction with the app. This is one more step forward towards a simple, uninterrupted UI.

### **Best Practices in Mobile App Design in 2020**
Now that we have looked at how drastically technology shifts affect design trends, we understand the importance of staying up to date.

##### Dynamic and Functional Animations

###### **Animations and microinteractions catch attention and create the right mood, so there's no need to add clutter or extra text.**

Animations are a big part of mobile app design trends this year. They not only set a positive tone of the mobile application but also bring it to life. It makes the conversation a two-sided affair and keeps the user immersed in the experience.

###### **Personalized animation is another trend that creates connection between your product and the user**

With personalized animation, the elements on the screen change according to the user's behavior. Modern analytical algorithms allow us to define the type of user and differentiate those who need detailed info from those who are just wandering around.

##### 3D Objects

As we have mentioned, new data transfer speeds provide a lot of opportunity for creating realistic visual forms. 3D objects give data visualization a realistic spin. These elements are eye-catching, exciting, and engaging.

Interaction with 3D models is similar to the offline experience, where the customer can view and touch the product. Such an approach evokes emotions and increases conversions.

The benefits 3D models add to the overall success of a mobile app and the experience it provides are immense. However, its development is not as easy as one would assume.

##### Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality

VR and AR give us a feeling of connection with the product and help build trust in it. AR is also a great example of immersion that speeds up information processing and goal achievement.

These technologies have definitely attracted the attention of the users. So making it part of your app design will definitely help you stand out from the crowd.
